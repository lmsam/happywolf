# Art Prompts for One Night Ultimate Werewolf Roles

These prompts are designed for AI image generators (like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or DALL-E 3) to create consistent, high-quality character art that matches a **Japanese Shonen Manga (Hot-blooded Youth Anime)** aesthetic.

## Global Style Settings
**Use these keywords at the start or end of every prompt to ensure consistency:**
> **Style:** Japanese Shonen Anime style, hot-blooded youth manga aesthetic, cel shaded, high contrast, dynamic action pose, intense dramatic lighting, speed lines (manga effect), expressive emotional faces, detailed line art, 4k resolution.
> **Vibe:** Energetic, intense, heroic, dramatic.

## Technical Specifications (Based on Game Layout)
The game uses two primary card display formats:
1.  **Table View:** Square cards (`100px x 100px`).
2.  **Draw/Detail View:** Portrait cards (`200px x 300px`, Aspect Ratio 2:3).

**Recommendation:**
*   **Generate in Portrait (2:3 Aspect Ratio).** This fits the Detail View perfectly.
*   **Center the main subject.** This ensures that when the image is cropped to a square for the Table View, the character's face/action is still visible.
*   **Resolution:** Minimum `1000x1500px` for high quality on retina displays.
*   **Format:** PNG or WEBP (transparent background is NOT required as cards have white backgrounds).
